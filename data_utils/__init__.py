        Under Python 2, `urlretrieve` relies on `FancyURLopener` from legacy
        `urllib` module, known to have issues with proxy management.

        Arguments:
            url: url to retrieve.
            filename: where to store the retrieved data locally.
            reporthook: a hook function that will be called once
                on establishment of the network connection and once
                after each block read thereafter.
                The hook will be passed three arguments;
                a count of blocks transferred so far,
                a block size in bytes, and the total size of the file.
            data: `data` argument passed to `urlopen`.
